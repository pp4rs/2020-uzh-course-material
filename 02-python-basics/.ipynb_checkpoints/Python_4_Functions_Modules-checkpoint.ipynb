You can then import all functions from from your module by typing `import filename`. As with the modules above, you have to drop the `.py` suffix. Analogously to the import of functions from pre-installed modules, you can also import specific functions from your own modules. "

Finally, to import modules from packages, you have to type the following code into your program: `from package_name import module_name`.
