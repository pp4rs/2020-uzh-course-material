    "\n",
    "In this module, we introduce the `NumPy` module, which is perhaps *the* fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. Numpy provides the core tool of scientific computing, N-dimensional arrays, as well as tools to work with these arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy's N-dimensional array and functionality gives us, the user, efficient storage and operations on arrays - even when they grow large in size.\n",
